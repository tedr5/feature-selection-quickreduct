We primarily use the QuickReduct algorithm, which is based on rough set theory. This algorithm identifies relevant features without requiring additional information about the data.

## How It Works

- **Rough Sets**: This method groups similar objects based on their attributes and determines which ones are truly important.
- **QuickReduct**: This algorithm analyzes the attributes and selects those that maintain the same predictive capacity as the initial set.
- **Testing and Visualization**: We apply these algorithms to datasets from the UCI Machine Learning repository and present the results in the form of graphs ðŸ“Š.

## Why Itâ€™s Important

Attribute selection helps simplify models and improve their accuracy, which is crucial in various fields such as finance, healthcare, and marketing.
